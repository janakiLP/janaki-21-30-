      <h2 class="head" align="center">Distance Education in the<br>
        Online World: Implications<br>
        for Higher Education</h2><br>

      <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this chapter, the authors identify forces leading to change in industries<br>
        in the online world, including increasing global competition, increasingly<br>
        powerful consumers and rapid changes in technology. In the higher education<br>
        industry, outcomes are evolving, but include the formation of alliances,<br>
        outsourcing and re-engineering of systems and work practices. The commu-<br>
        nication and information technologies that created the online world also link<br>
        lecturers, tutors, and teaching resources to create the possibility of networked<br>
        education. The authors outline a “glocal” networked education paradigm that<br>
        separates out global and local resource development and global and local<br>
        learning facilitation. By embracing this separation, it is possible to develop<br>
        ways of working that allow the creation of a flexible model of education<br>
        delivery that is scalable and hence globally competitive. In this model, the<br>
        work of the university academic is changed considerably. The functions<br>
        traditionally performed by a single university academic are differentiated<br>
        and are performed by a network of learning facilitators. In this scenario,<br>
        university academics may find themselves responsible for the learning of<br>
        hundreds of students, but they may never find themselves face-to-face<br>
        with a single student.</p>
        <h4 class="head" align="center">INTRODUCTION</h4>
      <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the world moves online, pressure increases on industries and organi-<br>
        zations to change the way they do business. According to Turban, McLean and<br>
        Wetherbe (1999), pressures acting on industries and organizations result<br>
        from: the market, technology, and society. <i>Market pressures </i>include global<br>
        competition and consumers who are becoming more demanding; <i>technologi-<br>
        cal pressures </i>include the use of e-commerce to lower the costs of production<br>
        and transaction costs; and <i>societal pressures </i>include government regulations<br>
        and economic conditions (for example, through the use of subsidies, tax<br>
        policies, and import/export regulations).</p>
      <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The higher education industry and universities are subject to the same<br>
        pressures as other industries and organizations in the online world. For<br>
        example, in Australia, enrollment of foreign students was the country’s eighth<br>
        largest export earner during 1997/8 earning A$3.1 billion [the larger ones<br>
        being: coal (A$9.5b), tourism (A$8.0b), transport (A$6.7b), gold (A$6.2b),<br>
        iron (A$3.7b), wheat (A$3.6b) and aluminium (A$3.2) (AVCC, 2000)].<br>
        Because of the Internet, Australian universities must now <i>compete</i> with<br>
        universities from other countries offering online programs to those students<br>
        in their own countries. So universities must change the way they do business.</p>
        <p class="b"><i>Those institutions that can step up to this process of change will<br>
            thrive. Those that bury their heads in the sand, that rigidly defend the<br>
            status quo - or even worse - some idyllic vision of a past that never<br>
            existed, are at very great risk.…The real question is not whether<br>
            higher education will be transformed but rather how and by whom?</i></p>
        <p class="c"> (Duderstadt, 1999, p.1)</p>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To understand how universities need to be transformed, it is necessary to look<br>
            at the impact of distance education in the online world on higher education<br>
            organizational structures and work groups, including organizational roles,<br>
            workgroup dynamics, and communication. It is also necessary to examine which<br>
            structures and processes are needed to allow a university to exist and prosper in<br>
            an age of globalization and rapid changes in the information technology underly-<br>
            ing remote education and work. This chapter tackles these issues using a model<br>
            based on Giddens’ (1977) theory of structuration in which process (activity) and<br>
            structure are reciprocally constitutive, and the application of this theory to<br>
            information technology by Orlikowski and Robey (1991). Central to this model<br>
            is the view that change is not solely “technology led” or solely “organizational/<br>
            agency driven.” Instead, change arises from a complex interaction between<br>
            technology, people and the organization.</p>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The authors then consider, as a case study, Central Queensland Univer-<br>
            sity (CQU), which is a university in Australia that is responding to the</p>
        <p class="a">challenge of remote education and operation on a national and international<br>
            basis. CQU has been a distance education and on-campus education provider<br>
            since 1974 and is now Australia’s fastest growing university. Inherent in all<br>
            CQU’s operations is a model in which the organization, its members and its<br>
            partners are all constituents of a “glocal” network of learning facilitators.</p>
        <h4 class="head" align="center">IMPLICATIONS OF THE ONLINE WORLD FOR<br>
            STRUCTURE AND PROCESS IN INDUSTRIES<br>
            AND ORGANIZATIONS</h4>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In considering the implications of the online world for industry, it is<br>
            necessary to consider both <i>structure </i>and <i>process</i>, where process includes<br>
            <i>change processes </i>(Gregor & Johnston, 2000; 2001; Johnston & Gregor,<br>
            2000). For example, one defining characteristic of an industry structure is the<br>
            degree to which vertical integration has occurred. Vertical integration and<br>
            alliances are formed by negotiation over periods of time. The result is a<br>
            structure that becomes formalized to some extent. Further activities and<br>
            processes are needed to maintain the alliance and modify it as needed.</p>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Giddens’ theory of structuration, process (activity) and structure are<br>
            reciprocal (Giddens, 1977, 1984, 1991). As Giddens (1977, p. 121) states,<br>
            “Social structures are both constituted by human agency, and yet at the same<br>
            time are the very <i>medium</i> of this constitution,” or as Rose (1999, p. 643) puts<br>
            it, “Agents in their actions constantly produce and reproduce and develop the<br>
            social structures which both constrain and enable them.”</p>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This link between process and structure is also important at the<br>
            organizational level. In order to develop technology and systems to<br>
            survive in the online world, an organization must engage in certain<br>
            processes, such as business process re-engineering. These processes are<br>
            of great importance – many information systems fail and exhibit the<br>
            <i>productivity paradox</i> (Brynjolfsson & Hitt, 1998). This paradox refers to<br>
            the fact that investment in Information Technology appears to be unre-<br>
            lated to increased outputs. One explanation of the productivity paradox is<br>
            that some organizations do not pay sufficient attention to processes within<br>
            their organization when introducing new technology. If organizational<br>
            change is not implemented well, and work processes not redesigned, the<br>
            new systems do not lead to gains in productivity. Organizations that gain<br>
            in productivity appear to be those in which there is a restructuring of the<br>
            organization and flatter, less hierarchical structures with decentralized<br>
            decision-making.</p>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, it is necessary to consider change and processes of change as well<br>
            as structure. The authors have a particular view of organizational change. This<br>
            view is that change is “emergent.” Change is not solely “technology led” or<br>
            solely “organizational/agency driven.” Change arises from a complex inter-<br>
            action between technology and the people in an industry or organization<br>
            (Markus & Robey, 1988).</p>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conceptual model developed here is based on the structurational<br>
            theory of information technology of Orlikowski and Robey (1991). This<br>
            model posits four relationships: (1) information technology is a product<br>
            of human action; (2) information technology is an influence on human<br>
            action; (3) organizational properties are an influence on human interac-<br>
            tions with information technology; and (4) information technology is an<br>
            influence on the organization. The model is extended to include the<br>
            market, technological and societal influences from the external environ-<br>
            ment that affect an organization</p>
        <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what are the implications of the online world for industry structure and<br>
            process? Barriers to participating in electronic transactions are decreasing.<br>
            Rather than having networks only link existing trading partners in a tightly<br>
            coupled environment, new electronic markets can easily include larger<br>
            numbers of buyers and sellers (Malone, Yates & Benjamin, 1987).</p>
            <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand there is evidence for hierarchical arrangements<br>
                supported by electronic networks, with firms in many industries reducing the<br>
                number of their suppliers, and entering into contractual arrangements for the<br>
                supply of goods. These arrangements constitute <i>supply chain management.</i><br>
                The arguments from economic theory for the changes in market structures are<br>
                complex. Holland and Lockett (1994) propose an <i>“anything goes” </i>ior mixed-<br>
                mode hypothesis where firms develop different forms of market and hierar-<br>
                chical relationships that are maintained simultaneously. The interrelation-<br>
                ships and interdependencies of governance structure, asset specificity, market<br>
                complexity and coordination strategy will determine interorganizational<br>
                arrangements (Klein, 1998).</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A value chain consists of the movement of components through various<br>
                    stages of production and distribution as they are transformed into final<br>
                    products. A firm can decide to produce each of the goods and services needed<br>
                    along the value chain in-house or to outsource it. There is a view that greater<br>
                    use of interorganizational networks will lead to vertical disintegration and<br>
                    greater outsourcing. For example, instead of an organization having its own<br>
                    IT department, it may outsource this function to a specialist IT service<br>
                    provider. However, evidence to support this view is still being collected<br>
                    (Steinfeld, Kraut & Chan, 1998). Some expect disintermediation to occur,</p>
                <p class="a">where intermediaries are removed because of the ease with which they can be<br>
                    bypassed on electronic platforms. For example, retailers and wholesalers can be<br>
                    bypassed by the customer placing orders online directly with the manufacturers.<br>
                    It is not clear, however, that disintermediation will always occur. Instead, different<br>
                    forms of intermediaries may emerge; e.g., a cybermediary such as Amazon.com<br>
                    which to some extent replaces the traditional intermediaries, namely, book shops.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that maximum benefit is obtained from e-business when it is<br>
                    integrated with other applications in the organization. This integration can<br>
                    require re-engineering of the way in which the organization does business. E-<br>
                    business reduces the costs of handling paper-based information. For example,<br>
                    the cost to the U.S. Federal government of a paper check was 43 cents<br>
                    compared to two cents for an electronic payment (Turban, McLean &<br>
                    Wetherbe, 1999). Small companies can use the Internet for marketing and<br>
                    compete against firms globally at comparatively little expense. Employees<br>
                    can work from home or from different parts of the globe. Teams can be linked<br>
                    with electronic communication.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To summarize, the implications of the online world for industry include:<br>
                    market transformations, the need for alliances, changes in outsourcing<br>
                    behavior, and changes in the role and type of intermediaries. In addition, the<br>
                    need for re-engineering and the manner in which organizational change is<br>
                    approached must be considered carefully.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the implications for higher education?</p>
                <h4 class="head" align="center">CHANGING UNIVERSITIES</h4>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Universities and the higher educational sector face similar challenges to<br>
                    other industries in the online world.</p>
                <p class="b">
                   <i> Universities are due for a radical restructuring. After centuries of<br>
                    evolutionary changes, they are faced with carving out new roles and<br>
                    methods to get there. Today the predominant model is still the<br>
                    combination of traditional teaching and academic research as<br>
                    mapped out by Wilhelm von Humboldt in the last century. The<br>
                    guiding principles of Humboldt’s vision of the university are<br>
                    forschung und lehre (research and teaching) and of professors,<br>
                    einsamkeit und freiheit (solitude and freedom). But change is<br>
                    unavoidable and pressure for change is increasing from the public,<br>
                    the media, and political groups. This change is mainly driven by the<br>
                    new technological possibilities and the new learning environments<br>
                    they enable.</i></p>
                <p class="c"> (Tsichritzis, 1999, p.93)</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific implications for universities can be drawn from the conceptual<br>
                    model based on the structurational theory of information technology of<br>
                    Orlikowski and Robey (1991):</p>
                <p class="a">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organizational change arises from a complex interaction between tech-<br>
                    nology and the people in the organization. For example, information<br>
                    technology makes possible new learning environments and changed<br>
                    work practices for university staff.</p>
                <p class="a">•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Information technology can influence changes in organizational struc-<br>
                    ture. The improved communication options offered by advances in<br>
                    information technology support the formation of alliances and the<br>
                    “unbundling” of the functions of the university (content, packaging and<br>
                    presentation). This vertical disintegration, in which functions are differ-<br>
                    entiated and either outsourced or dealt with by partners in strategic<br>
                    alliances, creates new intermediaries in the learning/teaching network.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is evidence of organizational change arising from the interac-<br>
                    tion of technology and people in some universities. In Australia, online<br>
                    and videoconferencing systems are being developed as alternatives to<br>
                    face-to-face communication where the people are physically dispersed.<br>
                    These methodologies require both staff and students to change existing<br>
                    work practices and to acquire new literacies (Wallace & Yell, 1997). The<br>
                    new technological possibilities (and new learning environments that arise<br>
                    from the interaction between technology and the people) include: the<br>
                    Internet (facilitating synchronous and asynchronous interactions between<br>
                    learners); videoconferencing (facilitating tutorials comprising distributed<br>
                    groups of students, and also remote access to live lectures); digital<br>
                    libraries (as knowledge repositories); computer simulation (substitutes<br>
                    for laboratories); etc. Overall, the interaction of these new technologies<br>
                    with the people creates a learning environment in which learners, tutors<br>
                    and learning resources can all be networked.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These same technological possibilities also permit new working environ-<br>
                    ments for those responsible for the facilitation of learning. Thus lecturers can<br>
                    use the Internet for synchronous and asynchronous communication with<br>
                    colleagues, videoconferencing for meetings, digital libraries for research. The<br>
                    interaction of these new technologies with the people creates a teaching<br>
                    environment in which lecturers, tutors and teaching resources can all be<br>
                    networked.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also evidence of changes in organizational structure that have<br>
                    been influenced by information technology. Traditionally, universities have<br>
                    carried out all the functions relating to the provision of higher education:<br>
                    content production; packaging content; credentialing programs; presentation</p>
                <p class="a">to students; marketing; registration, payment and record keeping; and assess-<br>
                    ment. In the online world, these functions can more readily be “disintegrated”<br>
                    and the university can specialize in those functions which it regards as its<br>
                    “core business,” forming alliances for other functions or outsourcing to new<br>
                    intermediaries in the value chain</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marketing of a university’s programs can be outsourced to a<br>
                    company that specializes in researching the market and promoting the<br>
                    university. Recruitment can be better accomplished close to the student, and<br>
                    in the case of international students, in the student’s mother tongue by agents<br>
                    overseas. Library facilities could be provided by new intermediaries close to<br>
                    the students or provided online by cybermediaries. Fee payment, especially<br>
                    online payment, can similarly be outsourced to a cybermediary. If an institu-<br>
                    tion is offering on many sites and many countries, then outsourcing invigilation<br>
                    and related examination administration is necessary. Sylvan Learning Sys-<br>
                    tems (2001) is an example of an organization specializing in the function of<br>
                    assessment in the education value chain. Based in the USA, it offers com-<br>
                    puter-based testing services to educational institutions, for example the<br>
                    Graduate Management Aptitude Test (GMAT) and the Test of English as a<br>
                    Foreign Language (TOEFL).</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research, of course, can be conducted by others outside universities, so<br>
                    there is really no reason why this activity couldn’t be outsourced. But it could<br>
                    be argued that there is a nexus between research and teaching in universities<br>
                    that is essential for higher education.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functions of course development and materials development are<br>
                    perhaps the ones seen as most likely to remain with universities. But there are<br>
                    those who even suggest the need for outsourcing and alliances for the<br>
                    performance of these functions. Gibbons (1998, p.61) predicts that universi-<br>
                    ties “will learn to make use of intellectual resources that they don’t own fully.<br>
                    This is the only way that they will be able to interact effectively with the<br>
                    distributed knowledge production system.”</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the higher education industry there is an increasing number of<br>
                    instances of institutions delivering the content of others. UNext is an internet-<br>
                    based distance learning ‘university’ which utilizes content developed by the<br>
                    London School of Economics, the University of Chicago, Colombia, Stanford<br>
                    and Carnegie Mellon Universities, and delivers Master of Business Admin-<br>
                    istration (MBA) degrees to the corporate sector. UNext also handles the<br>
                    global marketing and management of the programs (UNext, 2001). Western<br>
                    Governors University (WGU) was formed in 1996 by the governors of the<br>
                    western USA to share higher education distance learning resources. It offers<br>
                    online access to over 500 distance education courses from over 40 higher</p>
                <p class="a">education institutions. It assesses students and awards degrees, but its<br>
                    programs are produced and delivered by the participating institutions (WGU,<br>
                    2001).</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gibbons (1998, p.61) suggests that a university should be regarded as “a<br>
                    sort of ‘holding institution’ in the field of knowledge production, perhaps<br>
                    limited to accrediting teaching done primarily by others while in research<br>
                    doing their part by forming problem-solving teams that work on fundamental<br>
                    issues.” This view sees the core business of the university as participating in<br>
                    knowledge production and credentialing the teaching programs of others. But<br>
                    if so many functions are outsourced, then an important new function must be<br>
                    added to the work of the university – the function of organizing the learning<br>
                    space – bringing all the outsourced functions together to facilitate learning by<br>
                    the students. Indeed, one could say that the organization of the learning space<br>
                    perhaps becomes the central function of the university.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the various functions of the higher education process are differentiated,<br>
                    so too the <i>nature of work </i>and the <i>workforce</i> change (Coaldrake & Stedman, 1999).<br>
                    The authors now consider a case study that illustrates this change.

                        UNIVERSITY IN AUSTRALIA</h4>

                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central Queensland University (CQU) is a regional university in Austra-<br>
                    lia that is responding to the challenge of the online world. With 15,000<br>
                    students, CQU is now Australia’s fastest growing university in terms of<br>
                    international students. Only 25% of its students were in grades 11 and 12 in<br>
                    Australia during the last two years; the remainder are mature-aged or<br>
                    international students. In other words, CQU has a diverse student population<br>
                    quite unlike that of “traditional” universities.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Central Queensland, CQU’s traditional catchment area, Rockhampton<br>
                    is the location of the main campus; Mackay campus 350 kilometres to the<br>
                    North; Gladstone campus 120 kilometres to the South; Emerald campus 280<br>
                    kilometres to the West; and Bundaberg campus 330 kilometres to the South.<br>
                    A key component of this integrated network of campuses is the Interactive<br>
                    System-Wide Learning (ISL) system – a synchronous video link that facili-<br>
                    tates networked learning. Thus, on these campuses, classes are taught using<br>
                    combinations of synchronous video delivery of live lectures, videoconferencing<br>
                    to connect distributed groups of learners, web-delivery, synchronous and<br>
                    asynchronous computer-mediated discussions, and face-to-face classes.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CQU has been a distance education provider since 1974. Distance<br>
                    education students are serviced with a combination of printed, CD-ROM and</p>
                <p class="a">web-delivered material, as well as electronic asynchronous communication<br>
                    for class discussion and mailing lists.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CQU formed an alliance with a commercial partner, Campus Manage-<br>
                    ment Services, to establish campuses at Sydney in 1994, Melbourne in 1996<br>
                    and more recently in Brisbane and the Gold Coast. At these campuses the<br>
                    students are mostly of international origin. In addition, there are campuses<br>
                    operating in Singapore, Hong Kong and Fiji. At all these campuses, the CQU<br>
                    programs are tutored by locally appointed academic staff, specifically em-<br>
                    ployed for teaching rather than research. The mode of delivery is face-to-face<br>
                    for tutorials and lectures, supported by the distance education resource<br>
                    materials produced by the CQU academic staff in Central Queensland</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inherent in the CQU educational partnership with Campus Management<br>
                    Services is a model in which the function of content production has been<br>
                    detached from other functions traditionally carried out by the university (for<br>
                    example, lecturing). This vertical disintegration, in which functions are<br>
                    differentiated and either outsourced or dealt with by partners in strategic<br>
                    alliances, creates new intermediaries in the value chain.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For both on-campus and distance education modes, CQU has moved to a<br>
                    networked learning paradigm, using communication and information technolo-<br>
                    gies to link learners and learning resources. But it has also moved to a networked<br>
                    teaching paradigm that links lecturers, tutors and teaching resources.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are inherent dangers, however, in globalization coupled with the<br>
                    facility to network all teachers and learners. Inappropriate structures and<br>
                    processes for this global network have the potential to create stress for the<br>
                    individuals at the CQU campuses. When becoming more global, it is impor-<br>
                    tant to take care that the models used for teaching are scalable—for example,<br>
                    one coordinator in Rockhampton should not be dealing with a mailing list<br>
                    comprising one thousand students from all over the world.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also fears that the globalization of higher education could<br>
                    lead to a global western academic homogeneity—yet another wave of<br>
                    cultural imperialism. But the fear that global higher education will destroy<br>
                    indigenous cultures fails to acknowledge that other forms of communica-<br>
                    tion between cultures have existed for hundreds of years, and the fact that<br>
                    cultures survive such transculturation is evidence of cultural ‘resistance’<br>
                    and ‘adaption’ (McQuail, 1994).</p>
                <p class="b"><i>The intensifying of worldwide social relations sets up dialectical ties<br>
                    between the global and local, such that what happens in any<br>
                    particular milieu is an expression of, but also can often stand in<br>
                    contradistinction to, distanciated social forms.</i></p>
                <p class="c"> (Giddens, 1991, p. 210)</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when becoming more global, it is important to take care to create<br>
                    a system which does not seek to undermine cultural ‘resistance’ and<br>
                    ‘adaption,’ but which instead is responsive to the knowledge, culture and<br>
                    needs of the local learners. One aspect of this process is the<br>
                    “internationalising” of the curriculum to allow local knowledge and<br>
                    culture to be incorporated and valued.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To overcome the dangers mentioned above, it is important to move to<br>
                    a “glocal” meta-model in which the staff in each faculty of CQU are<br>
                    responsible for the organization of the global learning environment whilst<br>
                    the educational partners are responsible for the organization of the local<br>
                    learning environment (see Figure 1). Hence the portmanteau expression<br>
                    “glocal” – it is global and local at the same time.</p>
